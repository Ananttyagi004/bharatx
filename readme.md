## üß† How It Works

1. The API receives a `query` (product) and `country`.
2. Gemini 2.5 Flash model generates a Python list of site suggestions with product names, prices, currency.
3. Each listing is refined by querying Serper.dev (Google Search API).
4. Real URLs and snippet-based prices are extracted and updated in the result.
5. A clean JSON response is returned.
